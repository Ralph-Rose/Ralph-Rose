- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ralph-Rose
I am interested in Visual Studio 2015 and loading of .dll files to create assembly containing all classes and Methinfo class object of methods used in each class of Microsoft library.
I am having problem stating that not all .dll file contain header etc. to create an assembly.  This is from error message.
I am building database table containing contents of all assemblies so later when I was to get a particular MethodInfo object I know in which assembly or .dll file to look.
I am feeling a little like Microsoft is not supplying Visual Studio 2015 in same condition it was.  Because I do not find namespace System and class INT32 in database.
Could the location c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\V4.0.30319 be corrupted by loading later versions of Visual Studio.
I can be reached by email ralph.rose.job@gmail.com
